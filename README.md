# Pygame-Just-Blue
This Python code utilizes the Pygame library to create a simple interactive application that continuously draws random blue circles on a window. The circles vary in position and size, resulting in a visually dynamic effect. The code includes a main game loop that listens for the user to close the window to exit the application.
